This post captures my style, thinking process and how to better interact with me. The intention is to have a place where I can point people to when they want to learn how to better collaborate with me.

# My Style

* I have been a developer since 2002. I love to code. In my free time normally I'm [coding something new](https://github.com/rogeralmeida) just for the pleasure of coding.
* Like all good developers, I'm lazy! I want to do the minimum necessary and, if possible, automate it somehow.
* I'm a practitioner of visual management. And I prefer [Information Radiators over Information Refrigerators](https://www.roger-almeida.com/2016/12/information-radiators-vs-refrigerators.html).
* I like to ask questions. Questions are my favourite tool of engagement. Sometimes people perceive my questions as challenges. Most of the time **they are not challenges**, they are just my way of keeping my brain focused on the topic.
Other times they are nudges to guide people to a place that I believe is important to visit.
* If I have a challenge for the idea discussed, I would say it without a question. E.g. "That doesn't sound good to me", "I disagree", "Maybe is better if...", etc.
* I believe that a good team is a team that is prepared for the challenges ahead.
So I focus on "How can my team be \[prepared|better prepared\] for this \[challenge|project|task\]

# What I value

* **I value transparency over power**. I like to be transparent with the people around me and I expect that as well.
I like to be as transparent as possible, to the level of saying: "*I know more about it but I cannot disclose it yet*"
I believe that transparency requires maturity, that means that if I share a piece of information with you I expect you to be mature enough to handle it.
* **I value relationships over "efficiency at all cost"**. I spend more time with people inside the company than with my family during the week. So I want to create reasons to smile when I see you and vice-versa.
* **I value agreement over consensus**. I like people who have different opinions, but we must be able to agree on something and move forward.
* **I value servant leadership over the champions**. I prefer good team players, who are willing to work as a team than some excellent professional who has to work alone.
* **I value conflict not combat**. I have this tendency to keep people who have different opinions close to me. I believe they can help me cover my blindsides.

# What I don't have patience for

* People who believe they know everything.
* Disrespect with other people's struggles.
* People who cannot demonstrate empathy.
* Low quality work. (Quality is not negotiable)

# How to best communicate with me

* Face to face > Video > Voice > Audio message > Text Message/Whatsapp > ask someone to talk to me > e-mail
* Avoid irony. With English as a second language I still far from understanding irony in English.
* Start with the headline. Be straight. Don't be afraid that I will take your point as an aggression. I'm good at receiving feedback.
* I like to give space to people to explain their point of view, and I expect the same. If I could listen to you for a few minutes, I believe you can do it as well.
* If you want to move me, give me a question instead of an affirmation.
* Give me advice instead of opinions.

# How to help me

* Give me feedback. If you didn't like anything I did or something I didn't do when I should have done you can tell me, text me or email me.
* If you see any strange behaviour from anyone in my team, I encourage you to give feedback to the person first and then let me know. I encourage everybody to give feedback in person, but if you think I should pay more attention to something let me know.
* Don't be afraid to suggest me to change my course of action, e.g. in a meeting. I'm very open to suggestions and advice.

# What people misunderstand about me
* At home, I speak Portuguese, not Spanish. :smirk:
* Questions are my way to engage. If I question your idea it doesn't mean necessarily I disagree with it. I can just be the case that I want to learn more or I want you to expand your vision.
* I moved to Australia with my wife (who still learning English) and two kids. I have other things to think about besides work :wink:
* Although I can play guitar and sing, I struggle to do that in English. It takes me weeks to learn a new song in English, while in portuguese, I can learn multiple songs per day.
