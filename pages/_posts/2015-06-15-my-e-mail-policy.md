excerpt: "An unconventional way of dealing with e-mail"

When I was working for [Atos](http://www.atos.net), the company's CEO started a [zero email initiative](http://atos.net/en-us/home/we-are/zero-email.html). His aim was for the employees not to use email for internal communications. I remembered what I thought about it: "It's impossible".
Now I believe that he was right.
This post explains how I deal with my professional email inbox.

<!-- more -->

## Keep email closed

I don't keep my email inbox open during the working hours. I open it just when I have to. I also disabled the email notification in my cellphone. That prevents me from check email whatever I see that a new email arrived.

## Schedule time to check email
I check my email twice a day, at 10:00 am and 04:00 pm. I have reminders in my calendar . That helps me organize my day and prevents me from being fooled by my weak memory.

## Time box email time
As an adopter of the [Pomodoro Technique](http://pomodorotechnique.com/) I keep track of the time I spend with email. What I noticed is that I need almost two pomodoros  to read/respond/forward/archive my emails. That means that I need almost two hours during my day only to deal with my email inbox.  That was so true when I was working for [ThoughtWorks](http://www.thoughtworks.com/). Now that I'm working for [DiUS](http://dius.com.au/) I'm trying not to sign in to so many email lists. My aim is to keep my email time in one pomodoro.

## So far, so good
Up until here I've described what I have been doing for one year. It's working fine and I've noticed that my productive increased since then. Before I was checking email every time I alternated windows. Now, I can alternate windows without the temptation of checking email. But there is one last step that  I wanna try...

## Vacation Responder On
From today on I'll keep my Vacation Responder On in my professional email. This is the message that I will send to those who send me email:

>Hi,
>This is a auto-reply to inform you about my email policy:
> * I keep my email inbox closed during the working hours;
> * I also disabled email notifications in my cellphone;
> * I check email only at 10:00 am and 04:00 pm.
> If you need to contact me before my email times, feel free to reach me by phone: XXXX XXX XXX. If you prefer you can use Whatsapp or Viber with this number as well.

I wanted to try it for a long time, but never had courage to actually turn it on. I'll use it for some time, and depending on the feedback I will keep it or not. Who knows, maybe it can became a new post.
